# Random things wondering to do

## High priority
- getSecret step => if no keys have to go back automatically
- getSecret step =>
  - showing results has to be prettier
  - there has to be a any-key waiting press to keep the results on the screen and on key press user can get back to menu

## Medium priority
- (*) infinite loop of editing/adding
- handle a bak file to avoid corrupted saving?

## Low priority
- custom fields?
- (*) remove panic where no needed
- better const (mainly steps ones) handling, it's shit now
- (*) single session => multiple vault handling?
  - consider context issues

# Doing (*)
- single session
- infinite loop stuff
- panic
